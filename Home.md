**Project Description**
This is a Forefront Identity Manager Workflow Activity that will allow a user to define the VB or C# code they want executed at run time.  The Workflow will compile the code and run it in a separate app domain when its initiated ([http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/dynamicCode/DynamicCode.htm](http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/dynamicCode/DynamicCode.htm)).  The UI will allow you to specify the input parameters, using statements, assemblies to include and where the result of the code execution will go. 

This concept was first introduced at [http://www.apollojack.com/2012/02/last-fim-workflow-you-will-ever-need.html](http://www.apollojack.com/2012/02/last-fim-workflow-you-will-ever-need.html) and I have been given approval to make the code available to you.  I hope it helps!
