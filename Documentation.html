<p>The source code should contain everything you need to get started. To install and begin using the FIM Workflow you will need to:<br>
<br>
1. Rebuild the Workflow code usng the appropriate Microsoft.ResourceManagement and Microsoft.IdentityManagement.WFExtensionInterfaces assemblies for your FIM environment<br>
2. Ensure MPR is set up to allow creation/modification of AIC objects<br>
3. Create AIC in FIM:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px">Activity Name: Insight.FIM.Workflow.Activities.CustomCodeActivity<br>
Assembly Name: Insight.FIM.Workflow, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=daa4bcd323c6d191<br>
Type Name: Insight.FIM.WebUI.Controls.CustomCodeActivitySettingsPart</p>
<p>4. Run Install.bat - installs assemblies to gac, assumes sharepoint templates folder location, performs restart of services, creates C:\Installs (cant be changed) folder for dlls that must be in a known location for run time complication of custom code<br>
5. Create a Workflow in the FIM Portal using the new Custom Code Activity<br>
6. Create an MPR to apply Workflow<br>
<br>
These instructions have also been provided in the Source Code in the Documentation/Readme.txt file.</p>
